## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

In this challenge I have learned a lot and I had a good practice over HTML5 and CSS . I also came to a know about many css properties which I was not aware off . It made me research a lot and I got to know a lot a new stuffs.

I have added a few code snippets below:

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card__stat__inner">
    <span class="card-value">
      <h2>10k+</h2>
    </span>
    <span class="card-label">COMPANIES</span>

  </div>
```
```css
.image-overlay {
opacity: 0.5;
border-top-right-radius: 6px;
border-bottom-right-radius: 6px;
}
.desktop {
filter: contrast(150%);
}
```



### Continued development

In future projects , I would like to focus on the css layout properties like flexbox , grid , etc..., I would also like to focus a lot on bootstrap .


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to learn a lot about new properties and nature of a few elements , I also learned how to use a new property . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN web docs](https://www.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing Website which helped me to understand many concepts of CSS. I'd surely recommend you guys to check out this site .
